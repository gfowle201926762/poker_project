# poker_project

Run poker.py using python3.6.

This file is the skeleton for describing a poker game. The functions in the player class describe the actions a player can take (call, fold, raise etc.) and for detecting the strength of a hand (straights, flushes, etc.) The table class has functions which describe the flop, turn, and river; dealing and clearing the table; and for deciding the relevant strengths of hands during a showdown.

More code will be added to create an AI which can decide the theoretically most profitable action to take.
